- 👋 Hi, I’m @JasperLawrence
- 👀 I’m interested in how close and imminent our self-inflicted end as a species is. Particularly I am curious to see how it plays out in the public's consciousness from 2021 on as more and more people realise that barring some spectacular technological escape, their end is nigh. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or trying to be able to maintain a cheerful disposition despite the lunacy and idiocy of our species.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely nothing right now.
- 📫 How to reach me: there are very few jaspers, and fewer still lawrence versions, you will figure it out if you want to.
